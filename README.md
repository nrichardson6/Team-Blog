Too many cooks are gonna spoil the stew
Too many cooks are gonna spoil the stew
Too many cooks are gonna spoil the stew
There ain't nobody cooking but me and you

Too many cooks are trying to get in your kitchen
The first thing you know there's something missin'
You got a real good oven, you've got a hot range, too
Let me butter your buns while you stir the stew

Too many cooks are gonna spoil the stew
Too many cooks are gonna spoil the stew
Too many cooks are gonna spoil the stew
There ain't nobody cooking but me and you

Too many cooks are gonna spoil the stew
Too many cooks are gonna spoil the stew
Too many cooks are gonna spoil the stew
There ain't nobody cooking but me and you

The stew that you're cooking, it smells so good
It's got everybody talking in in the neighborhood
